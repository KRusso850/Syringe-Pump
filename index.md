## Specifications of Syringe Pump.

Building a syringe pump comes with many advantages. Foremost, it is much more inexpensive than buying a 3D printer syringe pump for a new printer design outright. It also is a fun learning experience, where one can learn 3D computer aided design, electrical circuits, and hands on building. Presented here is a syringe pump modeled and assembled in Fusion360, and then electrically wired via Arduino to move the pump.

The resolution of the syringe pump is dictated by the speed at which the motor moves. A slower speed allows for higher resolution, while a faster speed will yield a lower resolution print.

The max flow rate is dictated by the thread angle of the threaded rod and the step size. These two varaibles are the limiting factors in flow rate out of the syringe.
